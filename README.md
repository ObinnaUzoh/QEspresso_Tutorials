# QEspresso_Tutorials
 

 Quantum Expresso tutorials on the electronic, phonon, and superconducting propertes of TiSe<sub>2</sub>. The tutorial features:

 1. Pseudoptential file generation using `ld.x`.
 2. Virtual crystal approximation to simulate crystal structure disorder or doping.
 3. Structural relaxation, band structure, density of states, and charge density calculations and plots using Gnuplot and Xcrysden.
 4. Phonon calculations using Density Functional Pertubation (DFPT) theory.
 5. Electron-Phonon calculations using the Electron Phonon Wannier Package (EPW).
 6. Bandunfolding to resolve electronic band structure of a supercell to a primitive cell based on the [BandUp](https://github.com/band-unfolding/bandup) program.
